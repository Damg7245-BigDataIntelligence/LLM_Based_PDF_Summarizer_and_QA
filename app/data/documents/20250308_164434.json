Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and \nspending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, \nthe rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors \ndetailed below. \nFourth Quarter 2024 Guidance\n•\nNet sales are expected to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared \nwith fourth quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from \nforeign exchange rates. \n•\nOperating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion, compared with $13.2 billion in fourth \nquarter 2023.  \n•\nThis guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal \nsettlements are concluded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at \namazon.com/ir.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below. Fourth Quarter 2024 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with fourth quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion, compared with $13.2 billion in fourth quarter 2023. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. Conference Call Information A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. Forward-Looking Statements These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.
